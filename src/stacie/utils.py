class UnitConfig:
    """Unit configuration for functions that print or plot values.

    This class never influences numerical values in STACIE's computations,
    such as attributes of a result object or other variables.
    It only affects printed or plotted values.

    The ``acint_unit``, ``freq_unit``, and ``time_unit`` attributes should be set as follows:

    - The values of variables in STACIE (and your scripts using STACIE) are always
      in "internal units".
    - The ``*_unit`` attributes are assumed to have the value of a "display unit" in
      the same internal units.

    For example, if your internal time unit is 1 ps and you want times to be reported in ns,
    set ``time_unit = 1000.0``, because your display unit (1 ns) is 1000 internal units (1 ps).

    To make these conventions easy to follow (and to avoid unit hell in general),
    it is recommended to pick consistent internal units for your system.
    For example, use atomic units or SI units throughout your code:

    - As soon as you load data from a file, immediately convert it to internal units.
    - Only just before printing or plotting, convert to display units,
      which is also how this class is used in STACIE.

    For example, when all variables are in SI base units and you want to display time in ns,
    frequency in THz, and autocorrelation integrals in cm^2/s, then create a :class:`UnitConfig`
    as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        units = UnitConfig(
            time_unit=1e-9,
            time_unit_str="ns",
            freq_unit=1e12,
            freq_unit_str="THz",
